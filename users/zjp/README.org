** Intro
This is mainly to integrate QMK with Emacs and further dissolve the barrier
between thought and code, by integrating the keyboard with the editor. Several
macros, which can be included from the header =emacs.h=, have been defined.

** =emacs.h=
This header houses macros which conform to Emacs defaults.

** =emacs-opinionated.h=
# TODO: Add link to my Emacs dotfile repository.
This header houses my own macros which depend upon various packages,
customizations, and macros defined in my init.el

** =sway.h=
Provides several functions that are useful to Sway or i3 according to the default bindings.

** =sway-opinionated.h=
Provides the same functionality as =sway.h= but according to my bindings.
